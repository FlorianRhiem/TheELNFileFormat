## Concepts used

The "Links" in eLabFTW are stored in the `mentions` property, they point to to the URL of the resource.

The comments are in the `comment` property.

A file `elabftw-export.json` is created during export and added to the archive, it corresponds to the JSON export on the entry by eLabFTW and might contain fields that are not present in the metadata file because too specific to eLabFTW.
